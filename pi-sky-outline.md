# Overview

+ Event starts at 9:15AM on 3/14/15
+ The "magic moment" is at 9:26:53.58 AM
+ Event ends at 10AM

# Part 1: Pi for pie and countdown -- MUST START PROMPTLY at 9:15AM

+ Countdown clock projected on dome
+ Audience members volunteer to recite digits (or write them down if many volunteer). Top **1? 2? 3?** win a pie.
+ Chat about pi in everyday life if needed to fill the time.

# Part 2: Pi in your hands -- start 9:30AM

+ Activities drawn from [Pi Zone](http://www.nationalpiday.org/explore.html)
    * Do as one large group, with 1 can per 4-5 people. Measure out length of string equal to height of can of tennis balls. Question: Will string wrap all the way around can? Answer: no...height is 3 × diameter, circumference is π × diameter, and π > 3.
    * In stations, rotating as desired:
        - Measure π from round objects: string to measure circumference and diameter, ratio to get π .
        - Measure π from round objects 2...a π graph: On whiteboard, draw two axes, diameter (x) and circumference (y). With a small round object, place left side at origin mark position of right end on diameter axis. Roll object up vertical axis one complete revolution and mark position on circumference axis. Points make a straight(ish?) line whose slope is π.
        - Make a colorful π chain. Strips of paper, 10 different colors, each representing one of the digits 0-9. Make a chain, each link is a strip of paper taped to make a loop, color matching the digits of π.

# Part 3: Pi in the sky -- start 9:45AM

Tour of circles/spheres in the sky. Stops include:

+ Daily motion of stars from Earth.
+ Earth from space, ISS turn on -- Earth is sphere, orbit basically a circle, π used to relate time of orbit to distance and speed.
+ View of Earth-Moon system -- Moon orbit nearly circular.
+ View of inner solar system -- orbits of planets nearly circular.
+ Visit inner planet, Mars has best surface detail -- another spherical body.
+ Visit Phobos or Deimos, which are **not** spherical -- point this out, then...
+ Visit Ceres, asteroid, is spherical -- one part of the definition of a planet or dwarf planet is that it is large enough that gravity alone determines its shape.
+ "Profound" observation: Gravity is isotropic, i.e. spherically symmetric, i.e. same in all directions, so gravity domination means round object 9or round objects imply gravity is spherical.
+ In any remaining time consider stopping at:
    * Jupiter or Saturn with orbits of large and small moons shown.
    * Whole solar system.
    * Oort cloud
    * Milky Way

 Only 39 digits past the decimal are needed to accurately calculate the spherical volume of our entire universe, but because of Pi’s infinite & patternless nature, it’s a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate more and more digits.
